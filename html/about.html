            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name's Ori. I'm a 3rd year industrial and managment engineer student at Ruppin Academic Center. 
                Before the degree I worked as a restaurant manager for a couple of years,
                and studied graphic design and traditional art online.
                These days I work at Global-E as a NOC engineer and very enthusiastic about data and information systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
               My goal is to improve my knowledge base and get familliar with more tools and skills, all while intergrating my creative thinking. 
            </p>
            <h2>Let's make something special.</h2>
